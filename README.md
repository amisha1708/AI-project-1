# AI-project-1
This project aims to analyze the Sleep Cycle and Lifestyle Dataset to uncover the relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep quality. By exploring sleep patterns, physical activity, diet, and overall health, we seek to highlight how various lifestyle choices—such as exercise, caffeine consumption, and stress levels—affect sleep quality and duration.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, which includes various features related to sleep and lifestyle choices.

Key Features:
Sleep Duration
Sleep Quality
Physical Activity Levels
Diet and Nutrition
Caffeine Consumption
Stress Levels
Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis by managing missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and correlations between lifestyle factors and sleep health through visualizations and statistical measures.
Model Development: Build predictive models to assess how lifestyle choices can predict sleep quality or sleep-related issues.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights on how individuals can improve their sleep health based on findings.
